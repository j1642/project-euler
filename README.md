# project-euler

Project Euler offers self-contained problems which require algorithmic thinking to solve.

The problems generally revolve around number theory, including prime numbers, Ulam spirals, combinatorics, and sets of integers with unique properties.

One of the more intensive and unique problems is Problem 54, which requires evaluating and comparing poker hands.
