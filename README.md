# project-euler

Project Euler offers self-contained problems which often require algorithm optimization to solve (in a reasonable amount of time).

The solutions broadly include number theory topics, including:
- prime numbers
- prime sieves
- Ulam spirals
- combinatorics
- sets of integers with unique properties

The [time_this.py decorator](https://github.com/j1642/project-euler/blob/master/project_euler/time_this.py) was written to quantify function execution times.
